# Auth.js (formerly NextAuth.js)

**Verified 2026-06-04.** Check the installed `next-auth` (or `@auth/*`) version first; re-verify if newer than below.

**Current stable**: v4 (`next-auth@4`) is still npm `latest`; v5 remains beta and is now maintenance-only. **LLM default bias**: NextAuth v4. `getServerSession(authOptions)`, a `[...nextauth]` route in `pages/api/auth/`, `useSession`/`getSession`, `withAuth`, and the name "NextAuth.js".

## The shift
The project rebranded to Auth.js and split into a framework-agnostic core (`@auth/core`) with wrappers (`next-auth`, `@auth/sveltekit`, `@auth/express`) and separate `@auth/*-adapter` packages. v5 collapses session reading into one universal `auth()` and moves config to a root `auth.ts`. Importantly, Auth.js is now maintained by the Better Auth team in maintenance mode; they steer new projects to Better Auth.

## Stop / Start
| Stop (NextAuth v4) | Start (Auth.js v5) |
| --- | --- |
| Calling it "NextAuth.js" / `next-auth.js.org` | "Auth.js" / `authjs.dev` |
| `getServerSession` / `getSession` / `getToken` / `withAuth` | The single universal `auth()` exported from `auth.ts` |
| Inline `authOptions` + a `[...nextauth]` handler | A root `auth.ts` exporting `{ handlers, auth, signIn, signOut }` |
| Hand-rolling GET/POST in the auth route | `export const { GET, POST } = handlers` |
| Adapters from `next-auth/adapters/*` | Separate `@auth/*-adapter` packages |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` / `NEXTAUTH_URL` | `AUTH_SECRET` (and `AUTH_*` provider auto-inference) |

## Gotchas
- v5 has been beta for years with no GA timeline, and is now maintenance-only. For greenfield work the maintainers themselves recommend Better Auth.
- `signIn`/`signOut` are imported from your `auth.ts` (server actions), not only `next-auth/react`.
- Choose Auth.js mainly to maintain existing v4/v5 codebases.

## Companion
The recommended successor for new work is [better-auth.md](./better-auth.md).
