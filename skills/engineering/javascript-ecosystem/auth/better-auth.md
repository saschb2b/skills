# Better Auth

**Verified 2026-06-04.** Check the installed `better-auth` version first; re-verify if newer than below.

**Current stable**: 1.6 (stable since 1.0 in Nov 2024). **LLM default bias**: most corpora predate its rise and do not recommend it at all, defaulting to NextAuth or the now-sunset Lucia. That blind spot is the main thing to correct.

## The shift
Better Auth is the fastest-rising option in 2026: a TypeScript-native, framework-agnostic, plugin-based auth framework that owns your database (via Kysely, Drizzle, or Prisma adapters) rather than delegating to an OAuth-only model. It pairs a typed server (`betterAuth({...})`) with a typed client (`createAuthClient`), with end-to-end inference. The Auth.js team now points new projects here.

## Stop / Start
| Stop (LLM default) | Start (current) |
| --- | --- |
| Treating Better Auth as experimental or unknown | A mature 1.x library (1.0 shipped Nov 2024) |
| Reaching for NextAuth or Lucia by default for new TS apps | Evaluating Better Auth first for self-hosted, DB-owned auth |
| Framework-coupled assumptions | One core across Next, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Astro, Solid, Hono, Express |
| Bolting on separate libs for 2FA, passkeys, orgs | Official plugins in the `plugins: []` array |
| Stringly-typed session access | Typed `auth.api.*` (server) and `authClient` (client) |
| Hand-writing auth tables | The schema generator (`@better-auth/cli generate` / `migrate`) |

## Gotchas
- It requires a database and a configured adapter; that is the main tradeoff versus Auth.js's lighter footprint.
- Pin versions: minor releases can carry breaking changes behind a beta cycle.
- Client and server are separate entry points (`better-auth/client` or `better-auth/react` versus `better-auth`); wire `baseURL` correctly.
- Lucia is deprecated and sunset (now an educational resource). Do not recommend it as an installable library; point here instead.

## Agent skills
Better Auth publishes official agent skills (`npx skills add better-auth/skills`) and an MCP plugin (better-auth.com/docs/plugins/mcp). Prefer them.
