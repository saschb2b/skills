# ODSF commands

Each command is a verb over a bundle. They share one invariant: when a command finishes, `node odsf-validate.mjs <bundle>` still passes. The normative rules each step relies on are in [spec.md](./spec.md); ready-to-edit shells are in [templates.md](./templates.md). ODSF is a profile of OKF, so the OKF verbs (`init`, `add`, `enrich`, `link`, `index`, `log`, `validate`, `export`, `consume`) carry over; ODSF adds four design-specific ones: `token` and `asset` (its two new projections), `edit` (change an existing concept in place, with the ripple checklist), and `migrate` (adopt an existing OKF bundle).

## `init`: start a bundle

Create the skeleton an agent can navigate from the first file.

1. Choose the bundle root, ideally a directory in version control next to the product it styles (for example `design-system/`).
2. Write a bundle-root `index.md` whose frontmatter declares **both** `odsf_version: "0.2"` and `okf_version: "0.2"`. This is the only `index.md` allowed frontmatter.
3. Create the domain folders, not file-type folders: `foundations/`, `components/`, `patterns/`, `behaviors/`, `guidelines/`, `styles/`, and `references/` as needed.
4. Add an `overview.md` (`type: Design System`) with the system's principles, and a `log.md` with a single `Creation` entry dated today.
5. Seed `styles/tokens.css` with a `:root` block, even if empty, so examples have a stylesheet to link.

Touches: `index.md`, `overview.md`, `log.md`, `styles/tokens.css`, the directory tree. Validate before moving on.

## `add`: write one concept

Add a single concept document. Resist documenting ten components at once; one good concept with its example beats ten stubs.

1. Pick the path. The path is the identity, so `components/button.md` is the button. Never name a concept file `index.md` or `log.md`.
2. Pick a design `type` from the §5 vocabulary (`Color`, `Component`, `Pattern`, `Behavior`, `Guideline`, …). Pick the most specific that fits; invent one when none does.
3. Fill the recommended frontmatter you can stand behind: `title`, a one-sentence `description`, `tags`, `status`, `generated: { by, at }` naming the actor that wrote it and when, `sources` for anything it derives from, and where they apply `tokens`, `examples`, `stale_after`, and `applies_to`.
4. Body it with the per-type conventional headings (spec §7): a foundation gets `# Tokens` / `# Roles` / `# Usage` / `# Do & Don't`; a component gets `# Anatomy` / `# Structure` / `# Tokens` / `# Variants & States` / `# Examples` / `# Behavior` / `# Accessibility` / `# Do & Don't`. Write `# Structure` (direction, order of parts, spacing steps as `{spacing.*}` tokens, sizing behavior, reflow per `{breakpoints.*}`) before `# Tokens`: structure decisions constrain the skin, not the reverse.
5. If the concept is a `Component`, `Pattern`, or `Guideline`, author its companion asset (see `asset`) and declare it in `examples`.
6. Link out to the concepts this one relates to (see `link`), add it to the directory's `index.md` (see `index`), and append a `log.md` `Creation` entry.

Touches: the new concept file, its asset(s), its directory `index.md`, `log.md`.

## `token`: define and project tokens

The first of ODSF's two additions. A token lives once and appears twice (spec §4); this command keeps the two in sync.

1. **Define** the token on the foundation concept that owns it, as frontmatter `tokens`. Group by category (`colors`, `spacing`, `typography`, `radius`, `motion`, …); a value is a string or a small map for a composite token (a type style). The foundation's frontmatter is the canonical definition.
2. **Reference, don't restate.** A component's `tokens` point at foundation tokens with the `{group.name}` syntax (`backgroundColor: "{colors.primary}"`), not a copied hex value. Express interactive states as separate suffixed entries (`button-primary`, `button-primary-hover`). A state that changes **no value** (a hover that only underlines) needs **no** entry, show it in the `# Variants & States` table and `components.css` instead.
3. **Project only the foundation tokens** to `styles/tokens.css`, each as its resolved literal value, by the mechanical rule: token path `a.b.c` → custom property `--a-b-c`, under `:root`. A **component** token entry does **not** project to a custom property; it is realized as a rule in `styles/components.css` that consumes the foundation property with `var(--…)` (`.btn--primary { background: var(--colors-primary); }`). A `{group.name}` reference never appears verbatim in CSS, emitting the literal `{…}` is always wrong (spec §4). The frontmatter is the source of truth; regenerate the affected lines whenever you add, rename, or change a token.
4. Mirror the token in the foundation's `# Tokens` table so a human reader sees name / value / role, then validate. The checker warns on any `{group.name}` that does not resolve to a defined token.

Touches: the foundation concept's frontmatter and `# Tokens` body, `styles/tokens.css`, and for every component that references the token, its `var(--…)` rule in `styles/components.css`. A *change* to an existing token ripples further, follow the `edit` checklist.

## `asset`: author a companion example

The second addition. An asset is what makes a concept *reproducible* rather than merely *described* (spec §6).

1. Name it by the concept basename plus a role suffix: `<concept>.example.html` (the canonical correct usage), `<concept>.do.html` / `<concept>.dont.html` (a contrastive pair), or `<concept>.css` (concept-specific styles).
2. **Write the CSS rules in `styles/components.css`** (the shared sheet), not inline in the HTML. This is where a component's `{group.name}` token entries become real rules: each consumes a foundation custom property with `var(--…)` (`.btn--primary { background: var(--colors-primary); }`), never a hard-coded value, so a token change re-renders every example. Use one class-naming convention across every asset, the default is BEM (`.btn`, `.btn--primary`, `.btn__label`); document it once in the `Design System` overview. A `<concept>.css` file is only for styles too specific for the shared sheet.
3. Make `*.example.html` a **complete, standalone HTML document** that renders on a double-click with no build step. Link the bundle stylesheets with **relative** paths (`../styles/tokens.css`, `../styles/components.css`) so it resolves over `file://` and when served. Keep it **minimal**: the markup for the one thing the concept teaches, with the exact element, class names, attributes, and ARIA an agent should emit, not a page of chrome.
4. **Derive the wireframe** for every `Pattern` and any `Component` whose internal layout is non-trivial (spec §6). Copy the example's `<body>` **verbatim** into `<concept>.wireframe.html` and link one extra stylesheet last in its `<head>`: `../styles/wireframe.css`, the bundle-wide skin-stripping override sheet (author it once per bundle from the template; it neutralizes color, type family, radius, shadow, imagery, and motion with `!important` and outlines every box with `outline`, so every structural rule and media query in `components.css` still applies). Check the wireframe **before** the skinned example, at more than one width: if the gray version does not read right (order, spacing rhythm, hierarchy, reflow), no token will save it. Keep the two bodies identical from then on; the validator warns on drift.
5. **Snapshot a dynamic state** (loading, async, an open menu) the asset cannot animate: render it frozen with the right ARIA (`aria-busy="true"`) and a static indicator, or as a `*.do.html` / `*.dont.html` pair. For a `Guideline` (or a `Component` with a sharp failure mode), the do/don't pair shows both the intended result and the failure; the concept body explains *why* the don't is wrong.
6. **Cover every variant.** Each row in the component's `# Variants & States` table should have a matching element in the example, and vice versa, the validator checks that a declared asset exists, not that it is complete. (The wireframe inherits coverage automatically, since it shares the example's body.)
7. Declare each asset (example, wireframe, do/don't) in the concept's `examples` frontmatter list and link it from an `# Examples` body section, then validate. The checker warns on a declared or linked asset that does not exist.

Foundations earn assets too, and they are demos rather than usage snippets: a swatch sheet for color (with the on-color pairings), a specimen for typography, bar scales for spacing, a resizable grid for layout, shadow/radius boxes for elevation, live hover demos for motion, and an icon browser for iconography — every icon class in a searchable grid with size/context switchers and a per-icon detail view (surfaces, size ramp, aliases, copyable usage snippets), in the spirit of Material UI's icon search. A foundation whose only body is a token table describes the system; the demo shows it.

Touches: one or more `.html` assets, `styles/components.css`, `styles/wireframe.css` (once per bundle), the concept's `examples` frontmatter and `# Examples` body.

## `edit`: change an existing concept in place

The most common operation, and the one that silently rots a bundle if you skip a step. `add` writes a *new* concept; `edit` modifies one that exists (a new button variant, a retuned token, a deprecated state). Use this checklist as the ripple map: a token or variant change touches more files than the obvious one. Order matters, source of truth before projection.

Worked example, adding a `danger` button variant:

1. **Foundation token** (`foundations/color.md` frontmatter): add `danger: "#e03131"` and `on-danger: "#ffffff"` to the `colors` group, and the matching rows to its `# Tokens` table.
2. **`tokens.css`**: add `--colors-danger: #e03131;` and `--colors-on-danger: #ffffff;` under `:root` (the most-forgotten step).
3. **Component token** (`components/button.md` frontmatter): add the suffixed entry `button-danger` referencing `{colors.danger}` / `{colors.on-danger}`, plus the `-hover`/`-active`/`-disabled` siblings that the other variants carry, so `danger` is not a second-class variant. Add the rows to the component's `# Tokens` table.
4. **`components.css`**: add the `.btn--danger` rule consuming `var(--colors-danger)` / `var(--colors-on-danger)`. This is the rule that actually makes the button red.
5. **Example asset** (`components/button.example.html`): add a `<button class="btn btn--danger">` so the variant self-renders, and mirror the same element into `button.wireframe.html` where one exists (the two bodies stay verbatim-identical; the validator warns on drift). A *structural* change (a spacing step, a reordered part, a breakpoint) shows up first in the wireframe, so re-check it at more than one width before the skinned example.
6. **`# Variants & States` table** (`components/button.md` body): add the `danger` row (keep it in sync with the example, step 5).
7. **Provenance**: refresh `generated` (both `by` and `at`) on *every* concept you touched, and drop any `verified` event whose subject you materially changed, here **both** `color.md` and `button.md` (a token change usually edits two concepts; the singular "the concept's `generated`" elsewhere means each one).
8. **`log.md`**: prepend a dated `**Update**` entry.
9. **What does *not* change for a variant**: `index.md` (no concept added/renamed/removed, so the listing is unchanged, per `index`), the `examples` frontmatter list (you edited an existing asset, did not add one), and cross-links (still component → color). Touch these only when the set of concepts or relationships actually changes.
10. **Validate.** `{colors.danger}` now resolves, so the warning you would have seen after step 3-but-not-step-1 is gone.

Touches (typical token/variant edit): a foundation concept, `tokens.css`, the component concept, `components.css`, the example asset and its wireframe, two `generated` blocks, `log.md`. Not the indexes or links unless a concept or relationship changed.

## `enrich`: turn a source into concepts

Two passes. Use this when pointing the skill at a real design system: a token export, a component library, a Storybook, a Figma spec, or a docs site.

**When any source is a URL, do not run these passes ad hoc — run the [enrichment state machine](./enrich-machine.md).** It wraps the same work in explicit states with a persistent coverage ledger (`references/coverage.md`) and a loop-until-dry exit, so a crawl converges on the finest details instead of stopping at the first plausible pass.

1. **Walk the source.** Enumerate its units (every token group, every component, every documented pattern). One unit becomes one concept; one component becomes one concept plus its example asset.
2. **Structure pass.** For each unit, write one concept from the source's own data alone: a design `type`, the frontmatter you can derive (name, `description`, `status`), the `tokens` it defines or uses, and the per-type body headings. Fill `# Structure` from the source's own layout facts rather than inferring them from a screenshot: Figma auto-layout values (direction, gap, padding, resizing rules), grid specs, and existing flex/grid CSS state structure explicitly. Project tokens to `tokens.css` (see `token`) and author the example and wireframe (see `asset`).
3. **Web pass (optional).** Treat a list of seed URLs (the live site, a brand guideline, a design.md) as authoritative. Fetch each, and for each page either enrich existing concepts (confirm a hex, a class name, a state), mint a `references/<slug>.md` concept (`type: Reference`) for the page, or skip. Record what you read as `sources` entries, carrying `last_modified` where the page states it. Bound the crawl: cap pages and restrict to allowed hosts.
4. **Wire the graph.** Add cross-links (a component to its foundations and behaviors, a pattern to its components, any concept to the guidelines that constrain it), labeling each relationship in prose.
5. **Generate indexes and a log**, then validate. This is the heaviest command; do it in slices and validate between slices.

Touches: many concept files, their assets, `styles/tokens.css`, a `references/` subtree, `index.md` at each level, `log.md`.

## `link`: assert a relationship

Connect two concepts and say what the connection means.

1. Prefer a bundle-absolute target beginning with `/`, for example `/foundations/color.md`. It survives moving the source file within its directory. Relative targets are valid too.
2. Put the relationship in the prose around the link, not in the link. `Press darkening follows [press states only](/behaviors/press-states-only.md)` says what the edge means; the link alone does not. Wire the ODSF relationships (component → foundations and behaviors, pattern → components, anything → its guidelines).
3. A broken link is tolerated, not an error, so linking ahead of a concept you have not written yet is fine. Note it in `log.md` if you want to come back.

Touches: the source concept's body.

## `index`: refresh progressive disclosure

Keep each directory's `index.md` current so an agent can choose where to descend without reading everything.

1. For each directory, list its concepts as a bulleted set of links with a short description each, and link the example (and wireframe) assets inline where they exist (`([example](button.example.html), [wireframe](button.wireframe.html))`). Group under headings; link subdirectories with a trailing slash. When a directory outgrows a single scan — around fifteen concepts — group its index under function headings (actions & links, forms, feedback & status, navigation, content & media, data display) instead of one alphabetical run; mature systems catalog by function, and agents descend faster through a category than a list.
2. An `index.md` carries no frontmatter, except the bundle-root one, which keeps its `odsf_version` and `okf_version`.
3. Regenerate the affected `index.md` whenever you add, rename, remove, or re-describe a concept in that directory. A stale index is the most common drift.

Touches: one or more `index.md` files.

## `log`: record a change

Append a dated entry so consumers and humans can see what moved.

1. Use a `## YYYY-MM-DD` heading (ISO 8601, required), newest first.
2. Lead the entry with a bold word by convention: `**Creation**`, `**Update**`, `**Deprecation**`.
3. Log meaningful changes (a new component, a token change, a deprecated variant), not every typo. A token change is worth a line because it ripples to `tokens.css` and every example.

Touches: `log.md`.

## `validate`: check conformance

Run the script, then read the warnings with judgment.

```sh
node odsf-validate.mjs path/to/bundle
```

**Pass the bundle root itself** (the directory that contains the root `index.md`), not its parent. The version declaration is only recognized on the `index.md` at depth 0 of the path you give, so pointing the checker one level up reports a spurious `must declare odsf_version` error on an otherwise-perfect bundle. It exits non-zero only on the hard requirements. The reviewer's checklist behind it:

- **Errors (must fix).** Every non-reserved `.md` opens with frontmatter carrying a non-empty `type`, and the bundle-root `index.md` declares `odsf_version`.
- **Structure (should hold).** `index.md` has no frontmatter except the root's version declaration. `log.md` date headings are `YYYY-MM-DD`. Reserved names are not used for concepts.
- **Provenance (the inherited OKF v0.2 gate, `--strict` on a v0.2 container).** No leftover `timestamp` or `# Citations`, every `sources` entry has a `resource`, every `generated` has a `by`, and `status` is one of `draft|stable|deprecated|experimental`. Gated only once the root declares `okf_version: "0.2"`, so an ODSF bundle still on the v0.1 container stays clean.
- **Warnings (judgment).** A missing `okf_version` (recommended, never required, only `odsf_version` is the added hard rule), a referenced example asset that is absent, an unresolved `{group.name}` token reference, a broken cross-link, a `*.wireframe.html` whose body markup diverges from its `*.example.html` sibling (the two views should share one body, spec §6), a non-ISO log date, an identity outside the actor convention, a `stale_after` that has passed, or a file that is not `.md`/`.html`/`.css`. None fail the bundle, because consumers tolerate them. Fix the real mistakes; leave the forward-references you meant.

`odsf-validate.mjs` runs the full OKF check plus the ODSF additions, so it is a strict superset of `okf-validate.mjs`, use it (not the OKF checker) on an ODSF bundle, or a missing `odsf_version` slips through silently. The one place it is deliberately laxer than the OKF checker is `status`, where it also accepts ODSF's `experimental` extension.

## `export`: produce a bundle from a source

The producer role: turn an existing design system into a bundle. (If your source is *already a conformant OKF bundle*, do not export, use `migrate`, it is one edit.)

**Structured sources** (a token JSON, a Tailwind config, a component library, a Storybook).

1. **Foundations first.** Map the token source to foundation concepts (a token group → a foundation), translate it into frontmatter `tokens`, and project to `styles/tokens.css`. Components reference these, so they must exist before you write components, do this pass first.
2. Map each component to a `components/<name>.md` (`type: Component`) and translate its metadata into the per-type body (`# Anatomy`, `# Variants & States`).
3. **Flatten framework markup to a vanilla asset.** A React/Vue/styled-component does not ship as-is; translate it: a styled-component or CSS-in-JS block → a `.btn`-style rule in `styles/components.css`; a `variant` prop → a modifier class (`.btn--primary`); a `theme.colors.primary` lookup → `var(--colors-primary)`; a boolean state (`loading`) → a snapshot with ARIA (spec §6). The `*.example.html` then carries the resulting class contract, the agent copies that, not your JSX. Keep the structural half of each rule (layout, spacing, sizing, order, media queries) separate in your head from the skin half as you translate, since the wireframe will render only the former; a Figma spec's auto-layout data is `# Structure` stated explicitly, so carry it there and into the layout properties of the rule.
4. **From a Storybook specifically**, the unit of truth is the story: each story's `args` seed the example markup, each `argTypes` variant becomes a `# Variants & States` row, and a `play`-function interaction becomes a `Behavior` concept.
5. Run `enrich` to add what the raw export lacks (behaviors, guidelines, accessibility), emit the tree, indexes, and a `log.md`, then validate. **At scale** (dozens of components), work in foundations-first slices and validate between them; keep the class vocabulary coherent across every example (spec §6) and the indexes fresh as you go, drift across many files is the failure mode here.

**Prose sources** (a design.md, a brand site, a docs page, a Figma spec). Fetch with your web-fetch tool, transform (don't paste) into structural concepts, mirror an external page as `references/<slug>.md` (`type: Reference`) with the URL in `resource`, a `generated: { by, at }` recording what fetched it and when, and a `sources` entry. A page is a moving target, so the concept is a dated snapshot; bound a multi-URL crawl with a page cap and an allowed-hosts list, and summarize-and-cite rather than copy a third party's text.

**From a live production site** (cloning a brand's shipped design system from its public pages), run the steps below as the [enrichment state machine](./enrich-machine.md) — states S0–S10 with a coverage ledger and a loop-until-dry exit, not a one-shot checklist. The stylesheet alone will lie to you: a long-lived site ships years of dead CSS beside the live rules. The procedure that survives contact, learned the hard way:

1. **Fetch both layers.** The rendered HTML of several representative pages (home, a category page, a detail page, a form page) *and* every linked stylesheet, including the font CSS — it names the real families, weights, and the icon font.
2. **Mine the CSS for candidates, confirm in the DOM.** Histogram the colors, font declarations, and breakpoints; inventory the class roots. Then, for every component you author, find its markup in the fetched pages and take classes, structure, and ARIA from *there*. Where the CSS holds two generations of a component (an old `.module-breadcrumb` beside a new `#breadcrumb-navigation`), only the DOM tells you which one is alive — author the one that renders today and note the other as legacy.
3. **Take the real assets.** Icon fonts, logo SVGs, watermark SVGs the site serves publicly: download them and embed as data URIs in the bundle stylesheets, so examples render the authentic glyphs offline and the bundle stays `.md`/`.html`/`.css`. Extract the site's complete icon-class-to-codepoint map from its CSS and use those names — never guess a glyph from its codepoint; icon fonts are full of aliases and near-misses. Substitute only what you cannot ship (a commercially licensed text face) with a documented fallback stack, and say so in the overview.
4. **Give every foundation a demo.** Foundations are not exempt from `asset`: color ships a swatch sheet with its on-color pairings, typography a specimen, spacing/layout/elevation/motion their scales and live hover demos, and iconography the **icon browser** — every icon class rendered from the real font in a searchable grid with size/context switchers and per-icon usage details, not a curated sample.
5. **Compose the system once.** Author a composition pattern (`patterns/landing-page.md` or equivalent) whose example rebuilds one whole real page of the source site from the bundle's own classes, and link it from the overview as "the whole system composed". It is the single best consumer test; every defect you would ship shows up there first.
6. **Sweep again, then gate on the anatomy.** After the first pass, re-walk each fetched page and diff its module inventory against the bundle's coverage — the second pass is where the quicklink rows, stat bands, share rails, and back-to-top squares surface. Repeat the sweep for every new source page you are shown. Then run the holistic coverage gate in [enrich-machine.md](./enrich-machine.md): states matrix, layering scale, imagery, `Voice`, `Accessibility`, site vocabulary — each shipped, or its absence recorded with a reason.
7. **Reconcile against the source.** Before calling it done, re-check every token and metric you wrote against the reference stylesheet: paddings, font sizes *and weights*, transition durations, rotations, icon codepoints. Guessed values survive the first pass; the diff kills them.
8. **Render-verify.** Screenshot the example assets (a headless browser will do) next to screenshots of the live site and fix what differs. Two classes of bug only appear rendered: layout (a clipped CTA, a button row that wraps under a wider fallback font) and state (a required field must not open in its error state — validation classes belong after first interaction, never in static example markup).

Note ODSF ships no turnkey DTCG/Tailwind importer or exporter, the compatibility is in the token shape (spec §12), so a conversion either way is a producer task you script per project.

The output of either path is a plain directory you can commit, tar, or drop into a larger repo.

Optionally emit a **dense digest** beside the bundle — an `llms.txt` generated *from* it (identity, guideline/behavior one-liners with paths, concept index, the resolved token projection), a few KB for context-limited consumers who cannot hold the bundle. It is a lossy artifact of the bundle, never a second source of truth: generate it mechanically, regenerate it with every change, and never hand-edit it.

## `migrate`: adopt an existing OKF bundle

For the natural adopter, an OKF user whose bundle already describes a design system. Because ODSF rule 1 *is* OKF conformance (spec §1), a conformant OKF bundle is one line short of ODSF. Do not rebuild it with `export`; upgrade it in place.

1. **Conform (required, one edit).** Add `odsf_version: "0.2"` to the bundle-root `index.md` frontmatter, beside the `okf_version` it already has. That alone makes `node odsf-validate.mjs` pass with zero errors, your bundle is now a conformant ODSF bundle. Switch your validator from `okf-validate.mjs` to `odsf-validate.mjs` (the strict superset) so the version rule is actually checked from here on.
2. **Enrich (optional, the upside).** Everything after step 1 is graceful gain, not conformance: lift hard-coded values out of prose into foundation `tokens` and project them with `token`; retype concepts to the §5 vocabulary (`Color`, `Component`, …); author `*.example.html` + `components.css` with `asset`; wire the graph with `link`; refresh indexes and log. Do as much or as little as you want, it is a valid bundle the whole way.

3. **If the OKF bundle is still on the v0.1 container**, run OKF's own `migrate` first (`timestamp` becomes `generated: { by, at }`, `# Citations` becomes `sources`, the root declares `okf_version: "0.2"`), then declare `odsf_version: "0.2"`. Both are cheap, and the rule that matters in both formats is the same one: name the actor truthfully and never backfill a `verified` event that did not happen.

Touches: `index.md` (the one required edit), then whatever enrichment you choose.

## `consume`: apply a bundle to a design task

The consumer role. Be forgiving by design (the spec requires it). Handed a task like "build a sign-up form, adhere to this design system":

1. **Orient** at the bundle-root `index.md` and the `Design System` overview for principles.
2. **Pull foundations:** load the relevant foundation tokens, or simply link/inline `styles/tokens.css`.
3. **Descend by need:** follow `index.md` and cross-links to the `Pattern`, `Component`, and `Behavior` concepts the task requires; don't read the whole bundle.
4. **Copy from the assets:** reproduce structure, class names, and attributes from the relevant `*.example.html`. The example *uses* the classes; `styles/components.css` *defines* them and `tokens.css` defines the values, so read `components.css` for the class contract and any layout primitives (`.stack`, `.row`) or state rules (`:focus-visible`) the example references but does not itself define.
5. **Stand the skeleton up before the skin:** lay out regions, order, spacing steps, and reflow from the `# Structure` sections and the `*.wireframe.html` assets first, check it at more than one width, and only then let the tokens paint it. Correct skin masks structural error, so judge structure while it is still gray. To review finished work at fine granularity, link `styles/wireframe.css` last into what you built and compare it against the bundle's wireframes.
6. **When a concept you need is absent, degrade, don't stall** (a partial bundle is normal): a missing `Pattern` → compose it from the `Component`s it would contain, stacked with the bundle's layout primitives; a missing `Component` → the nearest typed sibling (a password field is the text input with `type="password"`) or a primitive built from foundation tokens; a missing token → keep the `{ref}` literal or pick the closest value. Note what you improvised.
7. **Respect the rules:** honor the `Guideline` and `Accessibility` concepts in scope and the `*.dont.html` counter-examples.
8. **Stay forgiving:** tolerate missing tokens, absent assets, unknown types, and broken links; never refuse a bundle over them.

**Emitting into a host app** is not the same as linking from a bundle example: link or `@import` `tokens.css`, or inline only the `:root` subset you use, or translate to the app's token system, and do not paste a bundle stylesheet's `@import`s or global `body {}` rules into product code, take the custom properties, leave the chrome.

If you also modify the bundle while building (correcting a token, adding a state), you have become a producer too, follow the `edit` ripple checklist (`generated`, `tokens.css`, `components.css`, example, variant table, `log.md`), then validate.
