description: Author, validate, and maintain a design system for AI agents as a conformant Open Design System Format (ODSF) bundle, a profile (v0.2) of Open Knowledge Format v0.2 that adds design tokens, runnable HTML/CSS example assets, wireframe views, and design-oriented concept types. Commands init, add, token, asset, edit, enrich, link, index, log, validate, export, migrate, consume. Use when the user types /odsf or asks to package a design system for an agent, document design tokens, components, patterns, behaviors, or guidelines so an agent builds UI that matches it, capture a component's skeleton or wireframe (layout, spacing, order, hierarchy, responsive reflow), make a design system or component library agent-readable or portable, adopt or migrate an OKF bundle, project tokens to CSS variables, or follow the ODSF spec. Apply implicitly whenever you write or transform design-system knowledge an agent will build from (a token scale, a component spec), and whenever you edit an existing ODSF bundle.

# Open Design System Format (ODSF)

ODSF packages a **design system** as a self-contained *bundle* an AI agent can read, navigate, and apply to a task, with no SDK, no platform, and no lock-in. It is a strict **profile of [Open Knowledge Format v0.2](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md)**: everything OKF says about bundles, concepts, frontmatter, links, `index.md`, `log.md`, and versioning holds unchanged, including the v0.2 provenance and trust layer (`sources`, `generated`, `verified`, `status`, `stale_after`, and the actor convention). A design system is exactly the kind of knowledge that layer was added for, since "is this token still the brand's" and "has a human signed off on this component spec" are the questions an agent building UI from a bundle most needs answered. On top of that container ODSF adds three things: a **token model** (machine-readable design tokens, design.md's seed), **companion HTML/CSS assets** so a concept ships a concrete self-rendering example plus a wireframe of the same markup with the skin stripped, and a **design type vocabulary** so foundations, components, patterns, behaviors, and guidelines are first-class. The goal is a bundle you hand to an agent ("build this screen, adhere to this design system") that produces work that looks and behaves the way the system intends.

Use this skill two ways. Run a **command** on demand, or apply it **implicitly** whenever you shape design knowledge an agent will build from. The normative spec lives in [spec.md](./spec.md); per-command steps in [commands.md](./commands.md); copy-paste starting points in [templates.md](./templates.md).

## The two rules

A bundle is a conformant ODSF bundle when both hold: it is a **conformant OKF bundle** (every non-reserved `.md` concept opens with YAML frontmatter carrying a non-empty `type`), and the **bundle-root `index.md` declares `odsf_version`** in its frontmatter. That is the whole hard requirement: be a valid OKF bundle, and say you are an ODSF one. Everything else (the token model, the asset conventions, the type vocabulary, the body sections) is recommended structure a producer SHOULD follow and a consumer MUST tolerate the absence of. An OKF-only consumer reads an ODSF bundle and loses only the design niceties. Full conformance and the consumer contract are in [spec.md](./spec.md).

## Commands

Invoke as `/odsf <command> [target]`. Each is detailed in [commands.md](./commands.md).

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `init` | Create a bundle. Make the directory, a root `index.md` declaring `odsf_version` and `okf_version`, and the domain folders (`foundations/`, `components/`, …). |
| `add` | Write one concept document. Pick a design `type` (§5), fill the recommended frontmatter, body it with the per-type headings (`# Tokens`, `# Anatomy`, `# Do & Don't`). |
| `token` | Define or update a foundation's `tokens` frontmatter and project it to `styles/tokens.css` (`colors.primary` → `--colors-primary`). Keep the two in sync; reference foundation tokens with `{group.name}`. |
| `asset` | Author a companion `*.example.html` (or `*.do.html` / `*.dont.html`) plus its `styles/components.css` rules (consuming tokens via `var(--…)`), that renders standalone and shows the minimal correct markup. Foundations get demo sheets (swatches, specimens, scales); iconography gets a searchable icon browser with per-icon usage details. For every pattern and any non-trivial component, derive the `*.wireframe.html`, the same body linking `styles/wireframe.css` last to strip skin, and check it first, at more than one width. |
| `edit` | Change an existing concept in place (a new variant, a retuned token). Follows the ripple checklist so a token change reaches `tokens.css`, `components.css`, the example, the variant table, each touched concept's `generated`, and the log, none skipped. |
| `enrich` | Turn a source (a token export, a component library, a docs site, a Figma spec) into concepts, then a second pass that adds tokens, assets, behaviors, and citations. For URL sources, run the [enrichment state machine](./enrich-machine.md): bounded crawl, coverage ledger, loop until a full sweep finds nothing new. |
| `link` | Connect concepts with markdown links and name the relationship in prose (a component to the foundations it uses, a pattern to the components it composes). |
| `index` | Generate or refresh `index.md` listings so an agent can navigate by progressive disclosure. |
| `log` | Append a dated `log.md` entry (Creation, Update, Deprecation), newest first. |
| `validate` | Run the conformance check. `node odsf-validate.mjs <bundle>`, or the manual checklist in [commands.md](./commands.md). |
| `export` | Convert an existing source into a conformant bundle: a token file, a component library, a Storybook, a brand site, or a design.md. The producer role. For a live brand site, follow the live-site procedure in [commands.md](./commands.md): confirm every component against the fetched DOM (stylesheets keep dead generations), embed the site's real public assets as data URIs, demo every foundation, compose one full page, then reconcile against the source stylesheet and render-verify with screenshots. |
| `migrate` | Adopt an existing OKF bundle. Add `odsf_version` to the root `index.md` (the one required edit, since ODSF rule 1 is OKF conformance), then optionally enrich with tokens, assets, and types. Moving an ODSF v0.1 bundle to v0.2 is OKF's own v0.1-to-v0.2 procedure plus bumping `odsf_version`. |
| `consume` | Read a bundle to apply it to a design task. Orient at `index.md`, pull foundations, descend by need, copy from the example assets, honor the guidelines. |

## Implicit mode

Apply ODSF without being asked whenever design-system knowledge is being shaped for an agent to build from later:

- You are documenting a foundation (a color, typography, spacing, elevation, shape, or motion scale), a component, a pattern, a behavior, or a guideline an agent will reproduce. Write it as a concept with a design `type`, not loose prose, and ship its example asset, plus its wireframe when it is a pattern or a component with non-trivial layout.
- You are defining design tokens. Carry them as frontmatter `tokens` on the foundation that owns them and project them to `styles/tokens.css`, so the description and the runnable values never diverge.
- You are exporting or transforming a design system, a token set, or a component library for an agent. Emit a bundle, not a JSON blob or a screenshot.
- You are editing an existing ODSF bundle (a new variant, a retuned token, a deprecated state). Keep it conformant as you go, and follow the `edit` ripple checklist in [commands.md](./commands.md): a token change reaches the foundation, `tokens.css`, the component's tokens, `components.css`, the example asset, the `# Variants & States` table, every touched concept's `generated`, and `log.md` (the indexes and links only if the set of concepts or relationships changed). This is where bundles silently rot if you skip a step. A retuned token also invalidates any `verified` event on the concepts it touched, so drop those rather than letting an old sign-off vouch for a new value.

**Guard.** ODSF is for a design system an agent builds from, not human-only design prose. A brand deck, a Figma board, or a marketing page for people is not a bundle. When it is unclear whether an artifact is agent-facing, ask before converting it. Knowledge that is not design-specific (a data table, a runbook, an API) is plain [OKF](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md), not ODSF.

## Concepts and assets at a glance

An ODSF bundle holds exactly three file kinds. A concept's identity is its path minus `.md`, so `components/button.md` is the concept `components/button`.

- **Concept** (`.md`, carries frontmatter, REQUIRED `type`). A unit of design knowledge. `type` is descriptive and open; the conventional values are the foundations (`Color`, `Typography`, `Spacing`, `Elevation`, `Shape`, `Motion`, `Layout`), the building blocks (`Component`, `Pattern`, `Behavior`, `Guideline`, `Accessibility`, `Voice`), and the containers (`Design System`, `Reference`). Recommended frontmatter beyond OKF's: `tokens` (§4), `examples` (asset paths), and `applies_to`. `status` is now an OKF v0.2 key (`draft`/`stable`/`deprecated`); ODSF keeps `experimental` as an extension for a component that is shipped but whose API may still move, and an OKF-only consumer tolerates it as an unknown value. Prefer OKF's three when portability matters, and use `stale_after` rather than a permanent `experimental` to say the thing needs re-checking.
- **Asset** (`.html`, `.css`, no frontmatter). A concrete artifact a concept points at. A `<concept>.example.html` is the canonical correct usage; `<concept>.wireframe.html` is the same body with the skin stripped by `styles/wireframe.css`, the structural view; `<concept>.do.html` / `<concept>.dont.html` are a contrastive pair; `styles/tokens.css`, `styles/components.css`, and `styles/wireframe.css` are the shared stylesheets. Assets are not concepts and are exempt from the `type` rule; they exist to be referenced. A bundle SHOULD contain no file types other than `.md`, `.html`, and `.css`.
- **Reserved** (`index.md`, `log.md`). Keep their OKF meaning at every level. Only the bundle-root `index.md` carries frontmatter, solely to declare the versions.

## The token model

Tokens live once and appear twice, so the agent and the code it writes consume the same values:

- **Frontmatter `tokens`** on the foundation concept that owns them is the canonical, agent-readable definition. It is a map of groups (`colors`, `spacing`, `typography`, `radius`, `motion`, …) to named values; a value may be a string or a small map for composite tokens. A component references foundation tokens with the `{group.name}` syntax rather than restating values, and expresses interactive states as separate suffixed entries (`button-primary`, `button-primary-hover`).
- **`styles/tokens.css`** is the mechanical projection of the **foundation** tokens as CSS custom properties: token path `a.b.c` → `--a-b-c`, each as its resolved literal value, under `:root`. A **component** token does not project to a custom property; it becomes a rule in **`styles/components.css`** that consumes the foundation property with `var(--…)` (`.btn--primary { background: var(--colors-primary); }`). A `{group.name}` reference never appears verbatim in CSS. Keep the projections in sync (`/odsf token`); the frontmatter is the source of truth. Example assets share one class-naming convention (BEM by default) so a consumer can copy across components coherently.

This is ODSF's core "more": design.md stopped at frontmatter tokens; ODSF also ships the runnable CSS and the example that links it, so describing the system and using it never diverge.

## The structure layer

Every CSS property is either **structure** (boxes move, resize, or reorder when it changes: layout, spacing, sizing, order, the type scale, breakpoints) or **skin** (the same boxes just look different: color, the type family, radius, shadow, imagery, motion). Tokens carry the skin faithfully, and correct skin is exactly what masks structural error, so a component or pattern documents its skeleton twice: a `# Structure` body section (direction, order of parts, spacing steps as tokens, sizing behavior, reflow per breakpoint, written before `# Tokens`) and a `*.wireframe.html` asset, the example's body verbatim with `styles/wireframe.css` linked last to strip the skin and outline every box. The wireframe is derived from the same markup and structural CSS the example uses, so it cannot drift; resize it to watch the real reflow, and judge structure while it is still gray, both when authoring and when reviewing built UI at fine granularity (spec §6, §7).

## Validate

Run the bundled checker against a bundle directory:

```sh
node odsf-validate.mjs path/to/bundle            # tolerant: errors only on the hard rules
node odsf-validate.mjs path/to/bundle --strict   # producer gate, on a v0.2 container
```

It errors (exit 1) only on the hard requirements (a concept missing frontmatter or a non-empty `type`, or a root `index.md` that does not declare `odsf_version`) and warns, without failing, on the soft guidance a permissive consumer tolerates: a missing `okf_version`, a referenced example asset that is absent, an unresolved `{group.name}` token reference, a broken cross-link, a wireframe whose `<body>` diverges from its example's, a non-ISO `log.md` date, an identity outside the actor convention, or a file that is not `.md`/`.html`/`.css`. `--strict` additionally fails on the inherited OKF v0.2 producer findings (a leftover `timestamp` or `# Citations`, a `sources` entry with no `resource`, a `generated` with no `by`, an out-of-range `status`), but only once the root declares `okf_version: "0.2"`, so a bundle still on the v0.1 container validates clean. The reviewer's checklist behind the script is in [commands.md](./commands.md).

## Source

ODSF is published at [saschb2b/Open-Design-System-Format](https://github.com/saschb2b/Open-Design-System-Format) (spec, philosophy, templates, a zero-dependency validator, a single-file viewer, and three browsable example bundles cloning Claude, GitHub Primer, and Vercel Geist). It builds on Google Cloud's [Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog) (the container) and Google Labs' [design.md](https://github.com/google-labs-code/design.md) (the token model). ODSF v0.2 tracks OKF v0.2, so the two numbers stay aligned; ODSF's own additions did not change in this revision, and everything that moved moved because the container underneath it did. It remains an early, intentionally minimal standard designed for backward-compatible growth, so re-check the spec for fields added after this snapshot.
