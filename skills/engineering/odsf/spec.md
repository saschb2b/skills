# ODSF v0.1 normative reference

A faithful, structured distillation of the Open Design System Format v0.1 specification. Normative keywords (MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY, REQUIRED) carry their RFC 2119 force. When this snapshot and the [upstream spec](https://github.com/saschb2b/Open-Design-System-Format/blob/main/SPEC.md) disagree, the upstream spec wins.

ODSF packages a **design system** as a self-contained *bundle* an AI agent can read, navigate, and apply to a task with no SDK, no platform, and no lock-in. It is a strict **profile of the [Open Knowledge Format (OKF)](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md)**: everything OKF says about bundles, concepts, frontmatter, links, `index.md`, `log.md`, and versioning holds in ODSF unchanged. Where this spec is silent, the OKF spec governs; where the two conflict for a design concern, this spec governs within an ODSF bundle. On top of OKF's container, ODSF adds three things: a token model (§4), companion HTML/CSS assets (§6), and a design type vocabulary and body conventions (§5, §7).

The one-sentence framing: **OKF told us how to bundle knowledge for an agent; design.md told us how to write down a design token; ODSF bundles a whole design system the OKF way, linked into a graph an agent navigates from a task to the rule it needs.**

## 1. Conformance

A bundle is a **conformant ODSF bundle** when both hold:

1. It is a **conformant OKF bundle.** Every non-reserved `.md` file opens with a parseable YAML frontmatter block carrying a non-empty `type` field, and reserved files (`index.md`, `log.md`) follow their OKF structure.
2. The **bundle-root `index.md` declares `odsf_version`** in its frontmatter (a `<major>.<minor>` string, e.g. `"0.1"`).

That is the whole hard requirement: be a valid OKF bundle, and say you are an ODSF one. Everything else (the token model, the asset conventions, the type vocabulary, the body sections) is **recommended** structure a producer SHOULD follow and a consumer SHOULD exploit but MUST tolerate the absence of.

The consumer contract is OKF's, extended. A consumer **MUST NOT** reject a bundle because of:

- any condition OKF already tolerates (missing optional fields, unknown `type` values, unknown keys, broken cross-links, missing `index.md`);
- a missing, partial, or unknown `tokens` block;
- a concept that references a companion asset (HTML/CSS) that is absent;
- an unknown ODSF concept type;
- a missing `styles/` directory or `tokens.css`.

Producers aim to be precise; consumers aim to be forgiving. An OKF-only consumer (a graph viewer, a generic agent) can read an ODSF bundle and lose only the design-specific niceties.

## 2. Bundle structure

An ODSF bundle is an OKF bundle whose directories are organized by **design domain**, with non-markdown **assets** (HTML, CSS) living beside the concepts they illustrate.

```
bundle/
  index.md                      bundle-root listing; declares odsf_version (+ okf_version)
  log.md                        chronological change history
  overview.md                   type: Design System (the bundle-level overview)
  foundations/                  the design language: tokens and their meaning
    color.md  typography.md  spacing.md  elevation.md  shape.md  motion.md  layout.md
  components/                   reusable UI elements, each with a runnable example
    button.md  button.example.html  card.md  card.example.html
  patterns/                     compositions of components solving a recurring need
    form.md  form.example.html
  behaviors/                    interaction and state rules
    focus-visible.md
  guidelines/                   do/don't principles with rationale
    color-not-alone.md  color-not-alone.dont.html
  styles/                       the token set projected as consumable CSS (assets)
    tokens.css  components.css
  references/                   external sources mirrored as concepts (OKF carryover)
    design-md.md                type: Reference
```

Domain folders are a recommendation, not a requirement; the real relationship graph is the links (§8), which cross the hierarchy freely. The folders above are the **conventional** top-level layout a consumer SHOULD expect.

### Concepts vs. assets

ODSF bundles contain exactly three file kinds:

| Kind | Extension | Frontmatter? | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Concept** | `.md` | Yes (REQUIRED `type`) | A unit of design knowledge. The thing OKF conformance checks. |
| **Asset** | `.html`, `.css` | No | A concrete artifact a concept points at: a rendered example, a token stylesheet, component CSS. |

Assets are **not** concepts and are **not** subject to OKF's frontmatter rule. They exist only to be referenced by concepts (§6). A bundle SHOULD contain no file types other than `.md`, `.html`, and `.css`; a producer that needs another format (an image, a font) SHOULD link it by URL from a concept rather than embedding a fourth file type, keeping the bundle text-only, diffable, and portable. Reserved filenames (`index.md`, `log.md`) keep their OKF meaning at every level.

## 3. Concept documents

A concept is OKF's: a YAML frontmatter block followed by a structural-markdown body. Its identity is its path minus `.md` (`components/button.md` ⇒ concept `components/button`). ODSF uses OKF's recommended fields (`title`, `description`, `resource`, `tags`, `timestamp`) unchanged and adds these **recommended** keys, used where they apply:

| Field | Status | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | REQUIRED | string | The kind of design concept (§5). Descriptive, not registered. |
| `tokens` | recommended | map | Machine-readable design tokens defined or used by this concept (§4). |
| `examples` | recommended | list of paths | Companion asset files (HTML/CSS) that demonstrate this concept (§6). Bundle-absolute or relative paths. |
| `status` | recommended | string | Lifecycle: `stable`, `experimental`, or `deprecated`. Lets an agent avoid building on what is on the way out. |
| `applies_to` | optional | list of strings | Platforms or surfaces this concept governs (e.g. `[web, ios]`). Absent means "all". |

As in OKF, producers **MAY** add any other keys, and consumers **SHOULD** preserve unknown keys and **MUST NOT** reject a document for having them. `tokens`, `examples`, and `status` are conventions a design-aware consumer reads; an OKF-only consumer ignores them harmlessly.

## 4. The token model

A **design token** is a named, reusable design decision: a color, a font size, a spacing step, a radius, a shadow, a duration. ODSF carries tokens in **two projections of one source of truth**:

1. **Frontmatter `tokens`**, the human- and agent-readable definition, on the foundation concept that owns them (and, by reference, on the components that use them).
2. **`styles/tokens.css`**, the same tokens as CSS custom properties, ready to drop into real code or to be linked by the bundle's own example HTML.

A bundle SHOULD keep the two in sync; the foundation concept's frontmatter is the canonical definition and `tokens.css` is its mechanical projection.

**Frontmatter shape.** `tokens` is a map of **groups** to **named values**. A group is a token category (`colors`, `typography`, `spacing`, `radius`, `elevation`, `motion`, `breakpoints`, …); within it, each key is a token name and each value is a string or a small map of sub-properties (for composite tokens like a type style). The category names are conventional, mirroring design.md, and a consumer SHOULD recognize them; producers MAY add categories their system needs.

**Token references.** A token value, or prose, MAY reference another token with the **`{group.name}` syntax** (design.md's). A component's tokens point at foundation tokens rather than restating values:

```yaml
# components/button.md
tokens:
  button-primary:
    backgroundColor: "{colors.primary}"
    textColor: "{colors.on-primary}"
    radius: "{radius.md}"
    padding: "{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}"
```

A consumer SHOULD resolve `{group.name}` against the bundle's foundation tokens. An unresolved reference (the target token does not exist) is **tolerated**, like a broken link: the consumer keeps the literal `{…}` string rather than failing.

**The CSS projection.** Each token path maps to a CSS custom property by joining its segments with hyphens and prefixing `--`:

```
colors.primary            →  --colors-primary
spacing.md                →  --spacing-md
typography.body.fontSize  →  --typography-body-fontSize
```

`styles/tokens.css` SHOULD define these under `:root` so any example HTML (and any code the agent writes) consumes the identical values. This two-projection model is the core of ODSF's "more": design.md stopped at frontmatter tokens; ODSF also ships the runnable CSS, so the gap between *describing* the system and *using* it disappears.

**Variants and states.** A component's interactive states are expressed as **separate token entries** (design.md's convention), suffixed by state: `button-primary`, `button-primary-hover`, `button-primary-active`, `button-primary-disabled`. This keeps each state machine-readable and lets the CSS projection and example HTML stay one-to-one with the tokens.

## 5. Concept type vocabulary

As in OKF, `type` is **descriptive and open**: there is no registry and a consumer MUST tolerate unknown values. The conventional ODSF types a consumer SHOULD recognize and route on. Pick the most specific that fits; invent one when none does.

**Foundations** (the design language): `Color` (palette, semantic roles, theming), `Typography` (families, scale, text roles), `Spacing` (the spacing/sizing scale), `Elevation` (shadow/depth), `Shape` (corner radii, borders), `Motion` (durations, easings), `Layout` (grid, breakpoints, responsive rules), `Token Set` (a token group that fits no category above).

**Building blocks and rules:** `Component` (a reusable UI element; usually ships an example asset), `Pattern` (a composition of components solving a recurring problem, like a form or an empty state), `Behavior` (an interaction or state rule spanning components, like focus or loading), `Guideline` (a do/don't principle with rationale), `Accessibility` (a requirement like contrast, focus order, ARIA, motion-reduction), `Voice` (tone and microcopy).

**Container and external:** `Design System` (the bundle-level overview concept), `Reference` (an external source mirrored into the bundle, OKF carryover, like design.md or a brand site).

## 6. Companion assets

The asset is what makes an ODSF bundle *transferable* rather than merely *descriptive*. A concept SHOULD ship one or more concrete artifacts an agent can read and copy.

**Naming convention.** An asset shares its concept's basename, plus a **role suffix**, plus its extension:

| Asset | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `<concept>.example.html` | The canonical, correct usage. SHOULD be self-rendering. |
| `<concept>.do.html` | A correct example in a do/don't pair. |
| `<concept>.dont.html` | The matching counter-example, the mistake the guideline forbids. |
| `<concept>.css` | Styles specific to this concept, when not in a shared stylesheet. |

A concept declares its assets in the `examples` frontmatter list and SHOULD link them from an `# Examples` body section so both an index and a reader find them.

**Self-rendering examples.** An `*.example.html` file SHOULD be a **complete, standalone HTML document** that renders correctly when opened directly in a browser, with **no build step**. It SHOULD pull the system's tokens by linking the bundle stylesheet rather than hard-coding values. An asset links its stylesheets with **relative** paths (`../styles/tokens.css`), not the bundle-absolute form recommended for concept cross-links (§8): a relative path resolves both over `file://` and when served, so the example renders on a double-click. Because the example links `tokens.css`, it stays truthful automatically: change a token, and every example re-renders. Keep examples **minimal**: the markup for the one thing the concept teaches, not a page of chrome around it.

**Do / Don't pairs.** A `Guideline` or `Component` MAY ship a `*.do.html` / `*.dont.html` pair so the agent sees both the intended result and the specific failure to avoid. The concept's body explains *why* the don't is wrong; the asset shows *what* it looks like.

## 7. Body conventions

The body is structural markdown (OKF §4). Beyond OKF's `# Examples` and `# Citations`, ODSF defines **conventional headings per type**, used when they apply:

- **Foundation concepts** (`Color`, `Typography`, `Spacing`, …): `# Tokens` (a name / value / usage table), `# Roles` (semantic meaning of each token), `# Usage`, `# Do & Don't`, `# Citations`.
- **`Component`:** `# Anatomy`, `# Tokens` (the component's tokens and the foundation tokens they resolve to), `# Variants & States`, `# Examples` (links to the example assets), `# Behavior` (links to `Behavior` concepts), `# Accessibility`, `# Do & Don't`.
- **`Pattern`:** `# When to use`, `# Composition` (the linked components it assembles), `# Example`, `# Do & Don't`.
- **`Behavior`:** `# Rule`, `# States`, `# Example`, `# Accessibility`.
- **`Guideline`:** `# Rule` (one sentence), `# Why`, `# Do`, `# Don't` (linking the do/don't assets).

A consistent `# Do & Don't` section, with linked `*.do.html` / `*.dont.html` assets, is the single highest-value convention for steering an agent away from plausible-but-wrong output.

## 8. Cross-linking

ODSF uses OKF's links unchanged. Concepts link with standard markdown links, **bundle-absolute** (`/foundations/color.md`, recommended for stability) or relative. A link asserts a relationship whose meaning lives in the surrounding prose; the link is the edge, the prose is the label. Broken links are tolerated.

Relationships a producer SHOULD wire and label in prose:

- a `Component` → the foundation `Color`/`Typography`/`Spacing` concepts whose tokens it uses;
- a `Component` → the `Behavior` concepts that govern its interaction;
- a `Pattern` → the `Component` concepts it composes;
- any concept → the `Guideline` and `Accessibility` concepts that constrain it.

The result is a graph an agent walks from a task ("build a sign-up form") to the patterns, components, tokens, behaviors, and rules it needs, the same progressive-disclosure traversal OKF defines, specialized to design.

## 9. index.md and log.md

Identical to OKF. An `index.md` MAY appear in any directory and carries no frontmatter, except the **bundle-root `index.md`**, which carries the version declaration (§10) and is the one place ODSF frontmatter on an index is permitted. Each `index.md` lists its directory's concepts as a bulleted set of described links for progressive disclosure. `log.md` is a flat, newest-first list of `## YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601) date headings with prose entries (`**Creation**`, `**Update**`, `**Deprecation**` by convention).

## 10. Versioning

ODSF versions independently of OKF. The bundle-root `index.md` frontmatter declares **both**:

```yaml
---
odsf_version: "0.1"
okf_version: "0.1"
---
```

`odsf_version` is REQUIRED for ODSF conformance (§1); `okf_version` is OKF's own optional declaration and SHOULD be present so OKF consumers know which container version they hold. Both use `<major>.<minor>`; minor versions are backward-compatible additions, a major version signals a breaking change. A consumer that does not understand a declared version SHOULD attempt best-effort consumption rather than refuse the bundle.

## 11. Consuming an ODSF bundle

How an agent SHOULD use a bundle when handed a design task:

1. **Orient.** Read the bundle-root `index.md` and the `Design System` overview concept for the system's principles and the lay of the land.
2. **Pull foundations.** Load the foundation tokens relevant to the task, or simply link/inline `styles/tokens.css`, the runnable projection of all of them.
3. **Descend by need.** Follow `index.md` listings and cross-links to the `Component`, `Pattern`, and `Behavior` concepts the task requires; don't read the whole bundle.
4. **Copy from the assets.** Reproduce structure, class names, and attributes from the relevant `*.example.html`, restyled by the same `tokens.css`, not from a prose paraphrase.
5. **Respect the rules.** Honor the `Guideline` and `Accessibility` concepts in scope, and the `*.dont.html` counter-examples, so the output avoids the system's known failure modes.
6. **Stay forgiving.** Tolerate everything optional (missing tokens, absent assets, unknown types, broken links). Never refuse a bundle over them.

An agent that also edits the bundle becomes a producer: it refreshes the concept `timestamp`, appends a `log.md` entry, regenerates the affected `index.md`, keeps `tokens.css` in sync with the frontmatter, and re-validates.

## 12. Non-goals

ODSF deliberately does not:

- **Define a closed taxonomy.** `type` and token categories are open by design (OKF's principle). The vocabulary in §5 is conventional, not exhaustive.
- **Replace a design-token standard.** ODSF *carries* tokens and can export to the [W3C DTCG format](https://www.designtokens.org/) or Tailwind; it does not redefine them. The frontmatter shape is deliberately design.md-compatible.
- **Be a component framework or runtime.** Example assets are vanilla HTML/CSS that teach structure and styling, not a React/Vue/Web-Components library. A bundle describes a system; it does not ship one.
- **Prescribe tooling or a platform.** A bundle is just files. No SDK, account, or service is required to read, write, or serve one.
- **Validate visual correctness.** The spec checks structure (is it a conformant bundle), not taste (is the design good). Contrast and reference checks are advisory lints, not gates.

## 13. Relationship to OKF and design.md

ODSF sits between the two it builds on. **OKF** gives the *container*: the bundle, the concept, the one-field conformance rule, links, indexes, logs, versioning, and the producer/consumer independence that makes a bundle portable; ODSF inherits all of it and stays a strict OKF profile, so OKF tooling reads ODSF bundles unchanged. **design.md** gives the *content seed*: frontmatter design tokens, the `{group.name}` reference syntax, variant/state entries, and the do/don't framing; ODSF embraces that token model and keeps it compatible. **ODSF adds the rest**: first-class `Pattern` / `Behavior` / `Guideline` / `Accessibility` concepts, the OKF-style graph that ties a task to exactly the design knowledge it needs, a runnable `tokens.css` projection, and companion HTML/CSS assets that make an example concrete rather than paraphrased.

## 14. Design principles

- **A profile, not a fork.** ODSF adds the minimum to OKF to make design systems first-class and keeps every ODSF bundle a valid OKF bundle. One new hard rule, the rest recommended.
- **Two projections, one truth.** Tokens live once and appear twice (agent-readable frontmatter and runnable CSS), so describing the system and using it never diverge.
- **Show, don't just tell.** Every concept can ship a concrete, self-rendering artifact. An agent copies a correct example far more reliably than it follows prose.
- **Forgiving by default.** A consumer degrades gracefully through every missing optional part, down to "a pile of typed markdown," which is still useful. Adoption beats enforcement.
- **Format, not platform.** No cloud, model, framework, or account is ever required to read, write, or serve a bundle. ODSF's value is in being a shared format, not in owning it.

## Reference material

The upstream repo ([saschb2b/Open-Design-System-Format](https://github.com/saschb2b/Open-Design-System-Format)) ships the full spec, a [philosophy doc](https://github.com/saschb2b/Open-Design-System-Format/blob/main/PHILOSOPHY.md), copy-paste [templates](https://github.com/saschb2b/Open-Design-System-Format/blob/main/TEMPLATES.md), a zero-dependency validator, a single-file HTML viewer (the reference consumer), and three browsable example bundles cloning Anthropic's Claude (a fixed warm brand), GitHub's Primer (a theme-able light/dark system), and Vercel's Geist (a monochrome 70-component library). They show the format spans a fixed brand voice, a multi-mode component library, and a comprehensive system, all in the same bundle shape.
